Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.},

For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

Next Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented. Methods and Results. Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment. Conclusion. Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

The parallel algorithm developed is general in the sense that there is no restriction imposed on the size of the problem and that it is independent of the dimension of the hypercube. The comparison of this algorithm with the parallel algorithms based on the LU factorization show that the execution time is divided by a factor of two, approximately},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

	abstract = {SOAP (simple object access protocol) is a protocol that allows the access to remote objects independently of the computer architecture and the language. A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

At the highest level, users may specify and run distributed EAs simply by manipulating graphical displays. At the lowest level the framework turns becomes a P2P (Peer to Peer) mobile agent system, that may be used for the automatic distribution of a class of processes including, but not limited to, EAs.},

Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00500-008-0395-8},
	abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for modeling the arrival dates in time-stamped data sequences such as newscasts, e-mails, IRC conversations, scientific journal articles or weblog postings. These models are applied to the detection of buzz (i.e. terms that occur with a higher-than-normal frequency) in them, which has attracted a lot of interest in the online world with the increasing number of periodic content producers. That is why in this paper we have used this kind of online sequences to test our system, though it is also valid for other types of event sequences. The algorithm assigns frequencies (number of events per time unit) to time intervals so that it produces an optimal fit to the data. The optimization procedure is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and avoiding too many frequency changes, thus overcoming the noise inherent in these sequences. This process has been traditionally performed using dynamic programming algorithms, which are limited by memory and efficiency requirements. This limitation can be a problem when dealing with long sequences, and suggests the application of alternative search methods with some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability, such as the evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper. This algorithm is able to reach the same solution quality as those classical dynamic programming algorithms, but in a shorter time. We also test different cost functions and propose a new one that yields better fits than the one originally proposed by Kleinberg on real-world data. Finally, several distributions of states for the finite state automata are tested, with the result that an uniform distribution produces much better fits than the geometric distribution also proposed by Kleinberg. We also present a variant of the evolutionary algorithm, which achieves a fast fit of a sequence extended with new data, by taking advantage of the fit obtained for the original subsequence.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are readily available bioinformatics methods for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data, provided that such biological information is previously transformed to fixed-size, metric-based vectors. To increase the usefulness of SOM-based approaches for the analysis of genomic sequence data, novel representation methods are required that automatically and bijectively transform aligned nucleotide sequences into numeric vectors, dealing with both nucleotide ambiguity and gaps derived from sequence alignment.Results: Six different codification variants based on Euclidean space, just like SOM processing, have been tested using two SOM models: the classical Kohonen’s SOM and growing cell structures. They have been applied to two different sets of sequences: 32 sequences of small sub-unit ribosomal RNA from organisms belonging to the three domains of life, and 44 sequences of the reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 belonging to different groups and sub-types. Our results show that the most important factor affecting the accuracy of sequence clustering is the assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment-derived gaps. Although each of the codification variants shows a different level of taxonomic consistency, the results are in agreement with sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions and anticipate a broad applicability of this codification method.Contact: sole@eui.upm.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

First the system can identify the degree of regional cuisine style mixture of any selected recipe and visualize such regional cuisine style mixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams. Second, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style. Drawing on a large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.},

	abstract = {Automatic food image recognition systems are alleviating the process of food-intake estimation and dietary assessment. However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

	abstract = {We present snap-n-eat, a mobile food recognition system. The system can recognize food and estimate the calorific and nutrition content of foods automatically without any user intervention. To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

Based on our three-phase learning framework, we develop efﬁcient algorithms that can effectively learn Bayesian networks, requiring only polynomial numbers of conditional independence (CI) tests in typical cases. We provide precise conditions that specify when these algorithms are guaranteed to be correct as well as empirical evidence (from real world applications and simulation tests) that demonstrates that these systems work efﬁciently and reliably in practice.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.},
